# Movie Recommendation System 

This is a beginner-level Movie Recommendation System built using Python and a CSV dataset.

The main idea behind this project is to understand how recommendation concepts begin — starting from simple data analysis — before advancing to complex systems.

This project is created for learning purposes and is not intended to be a commercial or production-ready application.

---

## Project Motivation

Recommendation systems are often associated with platforms like Netflix or Spotify, but every advanced system starts with simple logic and structured data.

This project aims to:
- Practice working with realistic datasets
- Learn how recommendations can be generated from data
- Improve Python data-handling skills
- Build a clean and readable GitHub repository

---

## What This Project Does

In its current state, the system:
- Loads movie data from a CSV file
- Processes the data using Python
- Sorts movies based on ratings
- Displays top-rated movies as basic recommendations

The logic is intentionally kept simple and easy to understand.

---

## Dataset Information

The dataset is stored in CSV format inside the `data/` folder.

It contains the following columns:
- Movie title
- Genre
- Rating

This dataset is a sample created solely for educational use.  
In real-world applications, recommendation systems operate on large datasets with thousands of movies and user interactions.

---

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- CSV data handling
- Git and GitHub

Advanced machine learning libraries are not used at this stage to keep the focus on fundamentals.

---

## How the System Works

1. The CSV file is loaded using Pandas
2. Movie data is stored in a DataFrame
3. Movies are sorted based on their ratings
4. Top-rated movies are displayed as recommendations

This workflow represents the foundation of many recommendation systems.

---

## Future Scope

This project can be extended by:
- Adding user-based recommendations
- Filtering movies by genre
- Introducing similarity-based recommendation logic
- Using real-world movie APIs
- Converting the project into a web-based application

The current structure allows gradual improvement as skills grow.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate:
- Learning through hands-on practice
- Clean project structuring
- A clear understanding of data-driven logic

This project serves as a strong foundation for more advanced data science and machine learning projects in the future.
